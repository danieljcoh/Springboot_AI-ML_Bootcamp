    "Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that models the probability that something is either belongs to the identity of one thing or it doesn't. In more scientific terminology, it models the probability that an input belongs to a certain classification such as whether an email is \"spam\" or \"not-spam\". More complicately, and out-of-scope for this assignment, logistic regression can classify inputs into more than two categories, however, we don't get in to that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind how logistic regression works is that given data as input, we determine the probability of those data points belonging to a certain classification using something called a sigmoid function (S-shaped-curve) which grants a particular input a number between 0 - 1 with a 'decision threshold' of 0.5 (picture an imaginary line on a graph) where data points further away from that threshold (closer to 0 or 1, are weightly lightly to 'correct' the probability to the aboslute classification of 0 or 1 and heavily weighting data points that end up closer to that imaginary threshold to mitigate incorrect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use something called a loss function to help us determine the 'incorrectness' of a probabalistic guess using our sigmoid function, but that, too, is out of scope for this assignment, so I will skip that for now."
