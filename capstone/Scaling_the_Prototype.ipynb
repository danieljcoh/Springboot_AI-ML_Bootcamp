    "\n",
    "**Q: Can you scale your prototype?**\n",

    "**Q: Choice of Tools/Libraries?**\n",
    "- Answer: \"I chose Scikit-Learn with Joblib. While SparkML is great for terabytes of data, it introduces overhead latency. For tabular data up to ~10GB (millions of rows), optimized Scikit-Learn is actually faster and more cost-effective to deploy on a standard cloud server (like AWS EC2) than a distributed Spark cluster.\""
